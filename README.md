# Is Game Of Life Config Cyclic?

Implementation from scratch of Fully-Connected Neural network and using it determinate if a Game Of Life configuration is cyclic.

Game Of Life configuration is cyclic if after some number of generations the configuration is the same as the initial one.
 
 * Fully-Connected Neural Network is implemented in the file `NerualNetwork.py` which includes:
    - Backpropagation
    - Training
    - Activation Functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Binary, TanH.
 * Applying the logic of Game of Life is via the package `cellpylib`.
 * The network is using the package `NumPy` to manipulate and query the data.
 * MatplotLib  to display graph.
